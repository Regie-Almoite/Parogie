              A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a
              short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a
              modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with
              bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen
              facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and
              en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the
              most basic guest services and facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest
              facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with
              computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare,
              conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts,
              gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services.
              Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels
              and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique,
              high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer
              meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United
              Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to
              all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels
              provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom
              facilities.

            <h6 class="py-3">A bit of history</h6>
            <p>
              The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe.
              For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century,
              coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers.
              Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One
              of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in Exeter in
              1768. Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North
              America in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to
              spring up in the later part of the 19th century.

            Timeshare and destination clubs are a form of property ownership
            involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for
            seasonal usage. A motel is a small-sized low-rise lodging with
            direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Boutique hotels
            are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.
            A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through
            popular culture, such as the Ritz Hotel in London.

            Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for
            example at casinos and holiday resorts. Most hotel establishments
            are run by a General Manager who serves as the head executive (often
            referred to as the "Hotel Manager"), department heads who oversee
            various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), middle
            managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. The
            organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy
            varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by
            hotel ownership and managing companies.
